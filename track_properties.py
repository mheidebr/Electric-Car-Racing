class TrackProperties:
    """Class for holding the critical points of the track.
    A critical point is where a track property changes (turn radius) or
    a car constraint changes (max velocity).

    Class that holds relevant information about the track.
    Critical points list should consist of thses elements:
     - distance from start finish line (meters)
     - max velocity (meters/s)
     - velocity constraint, must be either "none" "linear" or "constant"
     - elevation of the track (meters)
     - width of the track (meters)
     - radius of the track corner (meters) should be 'None' if the track is straight
     - bank of the corner


    The intended use of this class is for the user to input critical points
    that represent the track and then call the generate_track_list function
    which will generate lists used for the simulation.

    THE HIGHEST distance_from_start_finish VALUE IS USED AS THE END
    OF THE TRACK DISTANCE
